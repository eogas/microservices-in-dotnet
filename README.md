# Microservices in .NET
This repo is just a dumping ground for code examples as I go through the book Microservices in .NET (2nd Ed) by Christian Horsdal Gammelgaard.
I am not the author of this book, nor am I associated with it in any way. I just wanted a place to put the code I write as I go through it.

For this reason I have not included a license on this repository as not to imply that I have any sort of ownership over this code. Most of the code
here will pretty closely match what is in the book (updated for current defaults), but I don't intend for this to act as a companion for other 
readers or anything like that.
